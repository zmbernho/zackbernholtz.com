					<h2>Robo Wunderkind</h2>
					<h3>The Goal</h3>
					<p>My goal was to create a model and controller simulation for the PlexiDrone. The goal was to be able to use this simulation to iterate through possible design changes more efficiently and determine the effects on performance of changing hardware components.
					</p>

					<h3>My Project </h3>
					<p>To write a MATLAB and Simulink based simulation system for Quad and Octorotor drone configurations to improve flight performance characteristics.
					</p>

					<h4>Other Projects...</h4>
					
					<p>I worked with the DreamQii team to create a fixed testing rig for all drone configurations. The system used an Arduino based control system and MATLAB GUI integration to gain experimental data and run automatic tests. The test rig allowed for plug-and-play hardware changes for motors, propellers, electronic speed controllers and batteries.</p>

					<h4>Expanded Testing Suite</h4>

					<p>As the simulation was completed I added on the functionality for a user to autotune the controller values for the drone. Depending upon how aggressive a user's flight plan was the user could set the controller values to allow for increased maneuverability and reaction. I also added in the functionality to play the simulation as a game to test specific flight maneuvers and gain simulated data on the PlexiDrone.
					</p>

					<h3>The Result</h3>

					<p>The DreamQii team has been using the testing rig and simulation to automate the selection of batteries, motors, propellers and other components. I'd like to thank my manager, and the entire DreamQii team for an incredible four month internship.

								<h2>Bedinx Commercial Vehicle Systems LLC</h2>
								<h3>My Experience</h3>
								<p>I had two major independent projects while working at Bendix, as well as daily testing and MATLAB software work.</p>
								<p>The Hardware-In-The-Loop lab contains the necessary components to simulate a medium-heavy duty truck on multiple track conditions. The interface uses dSpace for real-time implementation and actuation of pneumatic brakes and valves to design optimal pressure curves for a number of scenarios. Working on the Automated Braking System I was able to gain test data and optimize the brake pressure under low friction conditions such as on ice.
								</p>
								<p>I also worked on the lane departure system. This system would use radar scans and edge detection algorithms to determine if a driver had started to unintentionally drift out of their lane. In the event of this system haptic feedback was given back to the driver to alert them to the lane drift.
								</p>
								<p>During my co-op I also contributed to improving the Hardware-In-The-Loop lab, adding in functionality to automate testing procedures. The automation of testing procedures allowed for a full testing suite to be run on all potential surfaces, completing multiple maneuvers, and presenting the data results to compare potential changes to hardware and software.</p>

								<h2>SICK AG</h2>
								<h3>My Experience</h3>
								<p>My project at SICK was to design a new light grid model to replace four previous models. The goal was to make the smallest, least expensive light grid possible. A light grid works by having one long array of infrared LEDs and another long array of photodiodes. The two are placed across from each other and are used in safety and measurement systems. The design of this new light grid needed to incorporate as many of the features from the four previous products as well as increase the snesing accuracy. I worked with an electrical and an optical engineer to determine product requirements, constraints and goals.</p>
								<p>I designed the mechanical outer shell of the light grid, the internal mechanical components, and the end caps. To be able to meet all of the project goals the mechanical and electrical components were designed with the manufacturing process in mind. Using my knowledge of Systems Design Engineering I was able to design a product that would take far fewer steps to manufacture, thereby lowering one of the largest costs of the light grid.
								</p>
								<p>Other than just work I was also able to learn some German as well as explore Germany and a number of other countries in Europe, which was an incredible added bonus to my position at SICK.</p>

								<h3>My Experience</h3>
								<p>I started working with the Midnight Sun Team to develop the steering system for their new vehicle, Midnight Sun XI.</p>
								<p>The Midnight Sun Team is a student team at the University of Waterloo that designs, builds, tests, and races solar electric vehicles capable of highway speeds. The Midnight Sun XI is the team's first two seat vehicle and will compete in the 2016 American Solar Challenge, travelling from Ohio to South Dakota. Since the development of the steering system I have been involved with every aspect of the Midnight Sun team from marketing, sponsorship, electrical design, manufacturing, testing, and printed circuit board bring up. I have moved on from team member to Mechanical Manager and then to Project Manager, the post I have held for the past two years. 
								</p>
								<p>I managed a team of over 50 individuals towards completing our goal of creating this one-of-a-kind vehicle. The Midnight Sun Team has given me experience in Project Management on a large scale project, development of a vehicle costing over $250,000. I have learned more with the team then I have with any previous organization and I will continue to be involved with the Midnight Sun team after graduation.
								</p>
								<p>I am very excited to see the completion of Midnight Sun XI as the team moves forwards. To learn more about our team click below.</p>

									For the Multi-Sensor Data Fusion course I chose to work with the University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels Team (UWAFT) to create an occupancy grid and characterize their 2016 Camaro's rear facing ultrasonic sensors and camera. The goal of the project was to use the rear facing sensors and camera to detect objects, locate those objects and allow for future implementation of automatic parking. First the ultrasonic sensors were characterized to determine their accuracy, range, and sensing cone. The camera was then taken as a seperate system to determine it's abilities with regards to frame rate, sensing distance and view. The two data sets were combined to create an occupancy grid with increased reliability by using both the camera and the ultrasonic sensors. The use of these two systems together allows for the flaws in each system to be accounted for and a more accurate occupancy grid and sensing field of view to allow for automatic parking to be implemented in future.

								<p>For my fourth year design project I worked with a small team and a professor on improving a stroke rehabilitation robot. The purpose of the robot is to help stroke victims rehabilitate their upper-limbs after a stroke. The specific parts of the project I am involved in are the redesign of the ergonomic components to increase patient outcomes, the control system for ensuring a patient stays in the game play area, and the implementation of the game. I began by researching and designing an ergonomic arm rest for users while using the robot. I then developed the game that users would play while interacting with the robot to rehabilitate their arm movement. While in game play the therapist can set the robotic assistance level to help move the patient into the correct place or to resist their movement to gain strength. The control system involves a closed-loop system knowing the user's position, applied force to the robot, the goal position, and the therapists input.

									While working at DreamQii I used a 3D printer multiple times and realized it is an important tool for prototyping designs. I sourced a frame, motors, heated bed, and an LCD screen for the printer. I uploaded and edited a firmware package to an Arduino Mega to run all of the components. After troubleshooting the hardware and software I tuned the controller and temperature values to decrease print time and increase print quality.

									As a Canadian we all fall on the ice at least once a year. As a design project in third year I worked on a team to develop a jacket with a pneumatic safety system to create active protection in winter sports. As the user falls an Arduino and 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope are used to detect if the user is falling. When a fall is detected a pneumatic valve is opened and the back portion of the jacket expands as pressurized air fills it. Before the user hits the ground the jacket became fully inflated to cushion the users fall.
